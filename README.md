</div>

### Description

<html>This is the newest version of Jinx Alpha 2. There are many bugs in this program and some thing seem to be able to do things they can such as clicking oK on message boxes. I am still working on alot this be patient my friends. This version includes many new things such as the big thing the INTERNET. I made a very weak version on a text browser, Ir has about 6 apps so far and some built in. This version supposrts differant color schemes. PID viewer that i made borrowed from UNIX machines. I have a ruff part to drag and drop working. ATTENTION: TO MAKE THE INTERNET WORK JHP program must be running which is the parser. Keep pressing enter until the idle box comes up then you can run the icons at the bottom. Well like i said this is still a ruff version, so please give me some slack im woring real hard to get this to work half decent its DOS guys. :) Please VOTE OR COMMENT.
